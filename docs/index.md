# Azin

This is the official documentation for **Azin**.  
To get started, see the [installation instructions](install.md).

## What Azin Is (and Isn’t)

**Azin** is an experimental programming language currently in **early development**.

Right now, it’s still evolving, so it doesn’t fit neatly into a category yet.  
That said, the **intended direction** is clear:

- A **low-level language**, closer to **C / C++**
- **Direct register manipulation**
- **Inline assembly** as a core feature
- Minimal abstraction between the programmer and the machine

Azin is **not designed to be safe**, **friendly**, or **abstract**.  
It is meant to give the programmer **explicit control**.

## Current State

Azin is still experimental:

- APIs may change
- Features may break
- Documentation is incomplete

This project is about **learning, experimenting, and building**, not stability (yet).

## Short-Term Goals (Before Easter)

Things I want Azin to be capable of soon:

- Build a **CLI todo list application**
- Support **user-created libraries**
- Provide a simple **package manager** (pip-style)

These goals act as real-world tests to shape the language design.

More will be added as the language evolves.
