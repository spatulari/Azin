# Azin

---
This is the official documentation for **Azin**.  
To get started, see the [installation instructions](install.md).

## What Azin Is (and Isn’t)

**Azin** is an experimental programming language currently in **early development**.
I would say that Azin, is meant for low level development, but it is too early to do anything with it.

---

## Current State

Azin is still experimental:

- APIs may change
- Features may break
- Documentation is incomplete

This project is about **learning, experimenting, and building**, not stability (yet).

---

## Short-Term Goals (Before Easter)

Things I want Azin to be capable of soon:

- Build a **CLI todo list application**
- Support **user-created libraries**
- Provide a simple **package manager** (pip-style)

These look far off considering i rewrote the whole code and that there is no printing, but i hope i can reach it

---

More will be added as the language evolves.
